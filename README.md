# sarcasm_detection
Here we present a model to detect sarcastic comments built using the deep learning library of FastAi based on recurrent neural network. The model is trained with about 1 million comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit, half of which are actual sarcastic comments.

This repository only contains the notebook we used to train the model. The deployed sarcasm detection model can be accessed at this url: https://teikkheng-website.herokuapp.com/sarcasm
